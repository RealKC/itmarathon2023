# itmarathon2023

This is our submission to IT Marathon 2023, the "Modelarea Arhitecturii x86" section.

Our task was to write an emulator for an x86-like CPU, that had only 8 programmer
accessible registers (`R0` to `R7`), data manipulation instructions (`add`,
`sub`, `mul`, `div`), `mov`, `cmp` & jumps (unconditional and branches based
on the flags set by `cmp`), `call` and `ret`.

Our submission won first place.
